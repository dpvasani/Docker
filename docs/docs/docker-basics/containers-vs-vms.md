sidebar_label: 03. Containers vs VMs

## Overview
Containers and virtual machines both isolate applications, but they do so at different layers. Containers virtualize the OS userspace; VMs virtualize hardware and run a full guest OS. This affects performance, density, startup time, and operational workflows.

## Architecture
- **Containers**: App + dependencies run in isolated processes using namespaces and cgroups on a shared host kernel.
- **VMs**: Each VM runs a full guest OS on virtualized hardware via a hypervisor.

```text
Host OS (Kernel)
 ├─ Container A (process-level isolation)
 ├─ Container B
 └─ Container C

Hypervisor
 ├─ VM 1 (Guest OS + app)
 ├─ VM 2 (Guest OS + app)
 └─ VM 3 (Guest OS + app)
```

## Key Differences
- **Startup time**: Containers start in milliseconds/seconds; VMs in tens of seconds/minutes.
- **Density**: Containers are lightweight (no guest OS); more per host. VMs consume more memory/CPU per instance.
- **Portability**: Both are portable; container images are smaller and easier to distribute.
- **Isolation**: VMs provide stronger isolation boundaries by design; containers rely on kernel isolation (still strong, but shared kernel).
- **Management**: Containers favor immutable, image-based deployments; VMs often use config management within a long-lived OS.

## Use Cases
- **Containers**
  - Microservices, APIs, web apps
  - CI/CD pipelines and ephemeral test environments
  - Batch jobs and workers
- **VMs**
  - Legacy apps requiring full OS control
  - Multi-tenant strong isolation requirements
  - Custom kernel modules / different OS kernels

## Security Considerations
- Run containers as non-root, apply seccomp/AppArmor/SELinux profiles, minimize image surface.
- For strict tenant isolation, VMs (or Kata/microVMs like Firecracker) may be preferred.

## Networking and Storage
- Containers: overlay/bridge networks, name-based DNS within networks; volumes/binds for data.
- VMs: full network stacks per VM; block storage attached as virtual disks.

## Costs and Performance
- Containers: better resource utilization, faster scale, smaller images; ideal for elastic workloads.
- VMs: overhead from guest OS; suitable when isolation and OS-level control are paramount.

## When to Choose Which
- Choose **containers** when you need speed, density, and a 12‑factor workflow.
- Choose **VMs** when you need strong isolation, different kernels, or OS customization per workload.

## Practical Example
- Lift-and-shift legacy monolith → VM first; gradually carve services into containers.
- New greenfield microservices → containers from day one; orchestrate with Compose/Kubernetes.
